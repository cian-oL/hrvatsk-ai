# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Croatian language tutoring service that will integrate with our existing Next.js application. The service will consist of a FastAPI backend that connects to GROQ's large language model through LangChain to provide intelligent Croatian language tutoring capabilities. The system will leverage the existing PostgreSQL database infrastructure for user data and progress tracking, vector databases for memory management, support both text and voice interactions, and offer personalized language learning experiences including conversation practice, grammar correction, vocabulary building, and cultural context education.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts using the service THEN the system SHALL retrieve their existing Croatian proficiency level from the user table
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL adjust language complexity based on the stored proficiency level
3. WHEN a user demonstrates mastery of concepts THEN the system SHALL gradually increase difficulty and update their proficiency level
4. WHEN a user struggles with concepts THEN the system SHALL provide additional support and simpler explanations appropriate to their level

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Croatian language learner, I want structured lessons on grammar, vocabulary, and cultural topics, so that I can systematically improve my language skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a grammar lesson THEN the system SHALL provide structured explanations with examples
2. WHEN a user wants to learn new vocabulary THEN the system SHALL introduce words in context with usage examples
3. WHEN a user asks about Croatian culture THEN the system SHALL provide relevant cultural information and context
4. WHEN a user completes a lesson THEN the system SHALL track progress and suggest next steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the Next.js application, I want seamless integration with the Croatian tutor service, so that I can access tutoring features without leaving the main application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the tutor feature THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using existing user credentials
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history within their session
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL handle re-authentication gracefully
4. IF the tutoring service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service to be scalable and maintainable, so that it can handle multiple concurrent users and be easily updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users access the service simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without performance degradation
2. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting and queuing mechanisms
3. WHEN system updates are deployed THEN the service SHALL maintain availability through rolling updates
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and monitoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want my learning progress to be tracked and saved, so that I can see my improvement over time and resume where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes learning activities THEN the system SHALL save their progress to the existing PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN a user returns to the service THEN the system SHALL restore their previous progress and conversation history from PostgreSQL
3. WHEN a user's proficiency improves THEN the system SHALL update their Croatian level in the existing user table
4. WHEN a user requests progress reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analytics based on data stored in PostgreSQL

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Croatian tutor service, I want to implement a LangGraph-based workflow architecture, so that I can provide intelligent multimodal responses with advanced memory and reasoning capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service receives a user query THEN it SHALL process the request through a LangGraph workflow with defined nodes and edges
2. WHEN determining response type THEN the system SHALL use a router node to decide between text, audio, or image responses
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL inject relevant memories and context through dedicated nodes
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain state throughout the workflow execution

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to practice Croatian through voice conversations, so that I can improve my pronunciation and listening skills in addition to text-based learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user speaks in Croatian THEN the system SHALL accurately transcribe their speech to text
2. WHEN the system responds THEN it SHALL provide audio output with proper Croatian pronunciation
3. WHEN a user makes pronunciation errors THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and correction
4. WHEN voice quality is poor THEN the system SHALL request clarification or suggest text input as alternative

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Croatian tutor service, I want to maintain conversation memory and user learning context, so that I can provide personalized and contextually relevant tutoring experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with the system THEN conversation history SHALL be stored in the existing PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN storing user learning data THEN the system SHALL leverage existing user table structure and relationships
3. WHEN retrieving user context THEN the system SHALL access stored proficiency levels and learning preferences from PostgreSQL
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use vector database similarity search for relevant past learning interactions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a Croatian language learner, I want to practice with images and visual content, so that I can learn vocabulary and cultural context through visual learning methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL analyze it using GROQ's llama-3.2-90b-vision-preview model
2. WHEN describing images THEN the system SHALL provide Croatian vocabulary and cultural context related to the visual content
3. WHEN generating educational images THEN the system SHALL use FLUX.1 model via Together.ai to create relevant visual aids
4. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL store image paths in the LangGraph state for workflow management

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a Croatian tutor service, I want to implement conversation summarization, so that I can maintain context efficiently during long learning sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversation length exceeds 20 messages THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic summarization
2. WHEN summarizing conversations THEN the system SHALL preserve key learning progress and important details
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use conversation summaries to maintain context without overwhelming the prompt
4. WHEN storing summaries THEN the system SHALL update them incrementally as conversations progress

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a Croatian tutor service, I want to simulate realistic tutoring scenarios, so that I can provide contextually appropriate responses that feel natural and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL consider simulated tutor activities and schedule context
2. WHEN determining response style THEN the system SHALL adapt based on time of day and learning context
3. WHEN creating scenarios THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate Croatian cultural and linguistic contexts
4. WHEN maintaining character consistency THEN the system SHALL use a character card prompt to define tutor personality

### Requirement 13

**User Story:** As a security-conscious application, I want all communications to be secure and user data to be protected, so that learners can trust the service with their personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users communicate with the service THEN all data SHALL be transmitted over encrypted connections
2. WHEN storing user data, voice recordings, and images THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data protection measures
3. WHEN accessing external APIs (GROQ, ElevenLabs, Together.ai) THEN the system SHALL securely manage API keys and credentials
4. IF a security breach is detected THEN the system SHALL implement incident response procedures
